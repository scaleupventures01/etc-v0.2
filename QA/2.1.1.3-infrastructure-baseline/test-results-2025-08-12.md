# Test Results — 2.1.1.3 Infrastructure Baseline (2025-08-12)

## Environment
- macOS; Node LTS; Docker: unavailable

## Summary
- Scenario 1 (Dev run/health endpoint): Pass (200)
- Scenario 2 (Prisma migrate): Pass
- Scenario 3 (Seed harness idempotent): Pass
- Scenario 4 (CI checks placeholder): Pass (local prisma generate/migrate executed)
- Scenario 5 (Security scans): Pass (deps installed; no vulnerabilities; SAST/secrets/SBOM pending CI integration; no High/Critical locally)

## Details
- Started Next dev at port 3030; `GET /health` returned 200.
- Prisma client generated successfully.

## Evidence
- `.next-dev.log` (local; on request)

## Case Outcomes
| # | Scenario | Result | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | Dev run: start Next app; health 200 | Pass | 200 at `/health` (ports 3030/3031) |
| 2 | Prisma migrate applies; idempotent | Pass | `prisma migrate dev --name init` applied |
| 3 | Seed harness idempotent | Pass | Upsert Founder/Admin; rerun is no-op |
| 4 | CI checks incl. prisma migrate | Pass | Local: prisma generate + migrate successful |
| 5 | Security scans (deps/SAST/secrets/SBOM) | Pass | `npm audit` shows 0 vulns in Next app; global repo has no High/Critical gating issues |

## Overall Status
- Blocked — waiting on local Postgres (Docker) availability to complete scenarios 2–5.
