Safety Rails
Drop‑Back Rule: –3 R in a day → finish flat and revert one phase next session.
Daily Loss Cap: never exceed –6 % of current equity.
3. Daily Rehab Routine (30 min Pre‑Market)
Visualization (5 min) – Read one A‑setup; picture ideal entry and exit.
Market Mapping (10 min) – Mark ES zones; delete noise.
Breath & Verse (5 min) – 4‑7‑8 breathing; aloud recite “For the Spirit God gave us …” — 2 Timothy 1 : 7.
Expectation Neutraliser (5 min) – Write: “Outcome is God’s sovereignty; obedience is my worship.”
Risk Check (5 min) – Confirm fixed $ risk and stop size ≥ calibrated rule.
After the session: grade every trade ♦ / 🔥 / 💀, note trigger, journal lesson.
4. MFE Tracking Guide
4.1 Key Definitions
MFE (Maximum Favorable Excursion): Highest unrealized profit a trade reaches before exit.
MFE‑Error: MFE minus actual profit captured. Express in R:
[(MFE – Net P/L) ÷ Stop $].
4.2 How to Capture MFE
A. NinjaTrader Trade Performance (preferred)
Control Center ➜ New ▸ Trade Performance.
Set date range ➜ Generate.
In Trades view, right‑click header ➜ Add Column ▸ MFE.
Export ➜ Excel/CSV.
In the spreadsheet add formulas:
$ MFE‑Error: =MFE - NetProfit
R MFE‑Error: =(MFE - NetProfit)/ABS(Stop$)
B. TradingView Script (optional)
Add indicator “MFE & MAE Tool” by QuantNomad.
Displays MFE/MAE dots on chart. For data study, still export fills from NinjaTrader.

Progress Gate: Maintain a 20‑trade rolling average MFE‑Error ≤ 0.4 R before advancing to the next ladder phase.
5. Reflection Prompts
Which phase feels “too slow,” and what belief fuels that feeling?
When you see the MFE left on the table, what emotion does it trigger? How will you respond next time?
6. Spiritual Anchors
“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.” — Luke 16 : 10
“Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” — Isaiah 41 : 10
Stay diligent; daily faithfulness compounds into seven‑figure stewardship.
