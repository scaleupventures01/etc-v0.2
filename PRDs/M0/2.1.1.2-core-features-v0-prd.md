## 1. Executive Summary

Deliver a functional v0 of core features: Rules CRUD, a deterministic Verdict engine, Journal entries with optional verdict snapshots, and minimal Analytics. Operate local-first using existing storage utilities; gate subfeatures behind flags; keep evaluation deterministic with p95 ≤ 3s.

<a id="sec-2"></a>
## 2. Scope
- In scope:
  - Rules CRUD with enable/disable and ordering/priority semantics.
  - Verdict v0: evaluate active rules against a trade input; return verdict + rule hits.
  - Journal v0: create/edit entries (datetime, symbol, side, size, entry/exit, P&L, notes/tags); optional verdict snapshot.
  - Analytics v0: counts, win rate, average R:R computed from journal.
  - Local-first persistence via `js/core/storage.js`; document keys/schema.
- Out of scope:
  - Advanced analytics (MFE/ATR handled in 2.1.1.10 / 2.1.1.11).
  - AuthN flows (2.1.1.4) and external DB (2.1.1.3) until available.
  - Multi-tenant UI and role-based controls (later milestones).

<a id="sec-3"></a>
## 3. Success Criteria
- Happy path: Create rule → Evaluate verdict for a trade → Save journal entry with snapshot → View analytics, with zero console errors.
- Verdict p95 ≤ 3s; evaluation deterministic (same inputs → same outputs).
- QA results Overall Status: Pass; security scans report no High/Critical.

<a id="sec-4"></a>
## 4. User Stories
- As a user, I can define and toggle rules that shape my trading discipline.
- As a user, I can run a verdict and see which rules triggered and why.
- As a user, I can journal trades with key fields and optional verdict context.
- As a user, I can view basic analytics (counts, win rate, average R:R) from my journal.

<a id="sec-5"></a>
## 5. Functional Requirements
1. Rules CRUD (create, read, update, delete) with `active` and `priority` fields; stable evaluation order.
2. Verdict API: `evaluate(tradeInput, activeRules) → { verdict, reasons, hits }`.
3. Journal entry schema with optional embedded `verdictSnapshot`.
4. Analytics calculators derive aggregates on demand from journal records.
5. Feature flags to gate incomplete subfeatures; no broken navigation.

<a id="sec-6"></a>
## 6. Technical Requirements

<a id="sec-6-1"></a>
### 6.1 Architecture
- Module boundaries: `rules` ↔ `verdict` ↔ `journal`/`analytics`; keep pure functions where possible.
- Local-first storage adapter via `js/core/storage.js`; abstract keys behind helpers.

<a id="sec-6-2"></a>
### 6.2 Data Model
- Rule: `{ id, name, expression|params, active, priority, created_at, updated_at }`
- Verdict: `{ verdict, reasons: string[], ruleHits: string[], evaluated_at }`
- Trade (input): `{ symbol, side, size, entry, exit?, notes? }`
- Journal: `{ id, trade, verdictSnapshot?, pnl?, rr?, tags?, created_at }`

<a id="sec-6-3"></a>
### 6.3 Storage/Schema
- Keys (proposed): `etc_rules_v1`, `etc_journal_v1`, `etc_analytics_v1` (derived).
- Document versioning; include simple migration note for v2+.

<a id="sec-6-4"></a>
### 6.4 Validation
- Validate required fields; safe defaults; guard against invalid numbers/NaN.
- Deterministic evaluation order by `priority` then `created_at`.

<a id="sec-6-5"></a>
### 6.5 UI/UX
- Rules: labels, empty states, validation errors.
- Journal: form field hints; tags; success/failure toasts.
- Analytics: minimal card/table with counts and rates; avoid overclaiming.

<a id="sec-6-6"></a>
### 6.6 Legal/Privacy
- Educational-only copy on verdict/analytics views; avoid exposing personal data.

<a id="sec-7"></a>
## 7. Testing & Acceptance

<a id="sec-7-1"></a>
### 7.1 Test Scenarios
1. Create rule; list shows rule active and ordered.
2. Evaluate verdict for a sample trade; rule hits and reasons align with rule definitions.
3. Create journal entry with optional verdict snapshot; data persists across reload.
4. Analytics reflects journal data (counts, win rate, avg R:R) accurately.
5. Feature flags disable incomplete subfeatures without breaking navigation.

<a id="sec-7-2"></a>
### 7.2 Acceptance Criteria
- All scenarios pass in dev preview; zero console errors; verdict p95 ≤ 3s.
- Overall Status: Pass in QA results; security evidence attached; no High/Critical.

<a id="sec-7-3"></a>
### 7.3 QA Artifacts
- Test cases file: `QA/2.1.1.2-core-features-v0/test-cases.md`
- Latest results: `QA/2.1.1.2-core-features-v0/test-results-<yyyy-mm-dd>.md` (Overall Status: Pass required)

- Storage versioning: v1 → v2 migration rules and detection?

<a id="sec-9-8"></a>
### 9.8 Ready‑to‑Implement Gate
- Condition: All boxes checked in 9.4 AND QA results published with Overall Status: Pass and linked above.
