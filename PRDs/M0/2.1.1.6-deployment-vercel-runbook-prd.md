## 1. Executive Summary
Deploy to Vercel production and provide a basic runbook (build/envs/secrets, health checks, rollback).

## 2. Scope
- In scope: Vercel project setup, env variables/secrets, build config, health checks, basic runbook in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.
- Out of scope: advanced monitoring (handled later), custom domains (M2).

## 3. Success Criteria
- Successful deploy from main; health check green; runbook documents deploy/rollback.

## 4. User Stories
- As SRE, I can deploy and rollback reliably with documented steps.

## 5. Functional Requirements
1. Configure Vercel project and envs.
2. Health check endpoint and verification.
3. Runbook updates.

## 6. Technical Requirements
