## 1. Executive Summary
Introduce a daily ticket cap and counter‑trend brake (soft‑block with override note).

## 2. Scope (In/Out)
- In: Per‑day count cap; after two full‑R losses, restrict counter‑trend.
- Out: Hard broker controls; automation beyond advisory/soft block.

## 3. Success Criteria
- Cap enforced server‑side; override must record reason.

## 4. User Stories
- As Founder, I cannot submit trade 7 without acknowledging override.

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Policy engine evaluates submissions; returns advisory or soft‑block.

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Storage: per‑day counter; policy config.

## 7. Testing & Acceptance
- QA cases: `QA/2.1.1.9-trade-limits/test-cases.md`
