## 1. Executive Summary
Establish initial unit tests and a manual QA smoke run covering critical flows (create rule → verdict → journal → analytics; login/logout).

## 2. Scope
- In scope: configure unit test runner (Vitest), add baseline unit tests for core modules, and run manual smoke per PRD 7.1; publish results.
- Out of scope: full E2E automation suite (future work), performance budgets.

## 3. Success Criteria
- Unit tests run green in CI; manual smoke results published with Overall Status: Pass.

## 4. User Stories
- As QA, I can verify core flows with a concise, repeatable checklist.

## 5. Functional Requirements
1. Add/confirm unit tests for rules/verdict/journal/analytics modules.
2. Manual smoke run: document cases and publish results.

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Use existing `vitest` setup; ensure scripts `npm test` run in CI.

## 7. Testing & Acceptance
- Test cases: `QA/2.1.1.5-testing-v0/test-cases.md`
- Results: `QA/2.1.1.5-testing-v0/test-results-<yyyy-mm-dd>.md`

## 8. Changelog
- v1.0: Initial draft and QA scaffold created.

## 9. Collaboration & Review Workflow
- PM → VP-Product → QA → VP‑Eng

## 10. Excellence Checklist
- [ ] QA Pass published; CI green; roadmap and mirror updated
