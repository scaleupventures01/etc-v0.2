# Lessons Learned

A living log of key findings, root causes, and preventative actions across the project. Each entry captures:

- What happened (symptoms)
- Why it happened (root cause / 5â€“10 Whys)
- What we did (fix)
- How to prevent recurrence (actions / standards)

Entries are date- and scope-stamped and link to relevant PRDs, QA artifacts, and code paths.
