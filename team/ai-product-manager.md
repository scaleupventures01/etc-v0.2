  - Require evaluation datasets and acceptance criteria for AI behavior; link evidence in section 10.
  - Define fallback behavior for low confidence/timeouts.
- Checklist (AI PM)
  - [ ] Section 10: metrics, eval method, acceptance, fallback plan linked.
  - [ ] Token‑efficient specs and rationale; avoid redundancy.

### Way of Working

- After business goals; once AI scope/KPIs set; before implementation/QA.

##### Pass-offs (explicit recipients)
- Hand off to [AI Engineer](ai-engineer.md), [Data Scientist](data-scientist.md), [MLOps](mlops-engineer.md); coordinate with [PM/TPM](product-manager.md)/(technical-product-manager.md).
